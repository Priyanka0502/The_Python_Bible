Variables are just like little boxes in computer-memory that has a name and stores some value in it.
We store data in it and save it by giving some name.
To retrieve those values we should use the 'variable-name'.
variable has two things:
1. name
2. value
name=value(assignment operator in python is '=')

Variables in python are 'case-sensitive'

Variables are dynamically-typed(The variable type can change through-out our program) which is not in case of other programming lang.
In the below code we assigned an int value to the variable and the data-type
of the variable 'number' becomes 'int'.
We again assigned  a string value to the variable and its data-type became
'string' type.
This is what we mean by dynamically-typed.

Use lowercase variable names, with underscores(_) for spaces.

Q- Why do we use variable?
1. To keep useful or important data for future.
2. To make our code more organised.
3. To make our code easier to change



'''

number=1
print(number)
"type() function is used to check the data-type of variable"
print(type(number))
number='Priyanka'
print(number)
print(type(number))
